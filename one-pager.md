# Game Design Principles
_by Alejandro Ojeda_

#### 3 game design principles

1. "The player should always know what they are trying to do and how well they are doing it."
   1. In Valorant, players clearly see what abilities they can use, the credits available to buy guns, and the damage that is caused to enemy players. The time left before the spike is planted and the score of the match is also a clear showcase of what the objective is.
2. "Mechanics and rules should behave predictably"
    1. In Mario Kart, players are confident that a red shell will target-lock the player in front, whereas green shells won't.
3. "Let the player feel in control of outcomes through their own actions"
   1. In Valorant, player's actions determine the outcome of each round. Usually it's a distributed team effort but the game doesn't interfere with the outcomes nevertheless.

#### Pros & Cons of game design principles
Principle|Pros|Cons|
-|-|-
1|Gives the game cohesion and helps the player build skill|More complex UI design, parameter tracking, and data feedback to player
2|Easier for players to learn the game and remember commands|Requires developers to take an extrospective view of how the players will see the game
3|Victories and defeats are attribiuted to skill more than luck. This creates self-improvement engagement| Harder for developers to balance the game mechanics and abilities

#### Summary: usage of game principles
In my opinion letting the player feel in control of outcomes though their own actions is the most important principle out of all three. I plan on implementing this principle on my game by letting the player interact with the game world and applying the second and first game principles, where mechanics will feel predictable and the player will know what they are doing. I don't have a game idea just yet but I know that I want to make the gameplay 90% skill 10% luck.
