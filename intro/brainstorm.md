I want my game to be an airline tycoon. Players start with no money and all they can do is take a loan from the bank to make their first move (buy a plane, airport gate slot, hiring crew, etc). 

For the sake of immersion, I would like to simulate things like:

- real life airliner makers and models with real prices and costs of operation
- cost to operate at an airport depending on passenger volume and size
- crew management (hiring, payroll, etc)
- airplane maintenance
- flight routes

The game objective is to dominate the airline market and acquire other airlines. Essentially, become a monopoly.

A demographic for this game can go from kids to adults with interests in tycoon and strategy games.

A game mechanic could be buying or selling assets (airplanes, slots, etc.)
